## 🚀 Introduction

**statioPy** is a Python package designed to make time series analysis straightforward and efficient. This toolkit provides methods for computing, visualizing, and testing the stationarity of time series data.

Whether you're a data scientist, quantitative analyst, or a machine learning enthusiast, **statioPy** gives you the power to:

- Compute stationarity metrics.
- Visualize time series data with ease.
- Perform stationarity tests like Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS), and more.

## ✨ Features

- **`compute_stationarity`**: Calculates essential stationarity metrics, such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation.
- **`visualize_timeseries`**: Generates interactive and static plots for time series visualization.
- **`test_stationarity`**: Conducts stationarity tests and provides detailed results, including p-values and test statistics.

## 📦 Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install statioPy
```

## 🔧 Usage

```python
import statioPy as sp

# Load your time series data (e.g., pandas DataFrame)
data = your_time_series_data

# Compute stationarity metrics
metrics = sp.compute_stationarity(data)
print(metrics)

# Visualize the time series
sp.visualize_timeseries(data)

# Test for stationarity
test_results = sp.test_stationarity(data, method='adf')
print(test_results)
```

## 📊 Visualization Examples

```python
# Example of visualizing a time series
sp.visualize_timeseries(data)
```

## 🔍 Stationarity Tests

```python
# Example of running an ADF test
adf_results = sp.test_stationarity(data, method='adf')
print(adf_results)
```

## ✅ Testing

To run the package tests, use:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
