# Tests for Non-Stationarity 
    strict stationarity is satisfied when its distribution over time is constant
    weak stationarity
        - constant mean  
        - constant variance 
        - constant auto-co-variance 
        - constant moments  
        
    ## Trend Stationary Tests

        - Unit Root Tests
            - Dickey-Fuller Test
            - Philips Perron Test
    
    ## Weak Stationarity
            - Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test
