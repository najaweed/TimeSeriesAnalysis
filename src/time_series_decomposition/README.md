# methods for time series decomposition  
## single variate methods : 
    - Dynamic Mode Decomposition
    - Empirical Mode Decomposition
    - Seasonal-Cycle-Trend decomposition 

## multi variate methods :
    - Multi-Variate EMD and DMD
    - Multi-Variate and Constrained 
    - Multi Variate Seasonal-Cycle-Trend decomposition using LOESS 

## Notes
    - rule of partial and autocorrelation function in distinction between Seasonal and Cyclical part of time series
